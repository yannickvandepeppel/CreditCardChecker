# CreditCardChecker
This program does 3 things:
- Check the validity of a batch of credit card numbers
- Group the invalid numbers in a new batch
- Identify the companies the cards came from
  -> If no valid company is found, the program will log a message saying this, indicating the location of the invalid number in the batch
